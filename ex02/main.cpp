/*
Vector:
Random access to elements is very fast, with O(1) time complexity since elements are stored contiguously in memory. 
Insertions and deletions at the end of a vector are efficient, O(1) on average. However, insertions or deletions at the beginning or middle are slower, O(n), because all subsequent elements must be shifted.

Deque:
A std::deque (double-ended queue) is not contiguous in memory. Instead, itâ€™s implemented as a series of chunks (blocks of memory) or arrays, each pointing to another.
Insertions and deletions are O(1) at both the front and the back. Inserting at the middle is O(n), similar to std::vector.
